[Ember add-ons](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.3.0/addons-and-dependencies/managing-dependencies/) are packages of code that extend the functionality of Ember. There are thousands of add-ons available with countless for use in Ember applications. The first that we'll add to our applications is Bootstrap.

## Installing Bootstrap

Navigate to your project directory to install Bootstrap:

```
$ ember install ember-bootstrap
```

Once installed, you can peek into your `bower.json` and `package.json` files to see that Bootstrap has been added as a dependency to your application. **Restart the server to see changes in the browser.**

That is all you need to do to begin adding Bootstrap to any of your Ember templates.
