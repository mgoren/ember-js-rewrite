**Goals**:  Practice the Ember concepts and tools we've been exploring this week by beginning a two-day project.  The first day's focus lies in getting routing, templates, components and models in place for blog posts;  including save, update, delete and find functionality.  Day two focuses on implementing a one-to-many relationship between posts and comments.

## Warm Up
<hr>

* What is the purpose of defining Ember routes with dynamic segments? What added functionality do they offer?
* When we click a link to travel to a new route within our application, what series of events occur? How does traveling to a route with a dynamic segment differ from traveling to one without?
* What is a `RSVP.hash`? Why would we use one? Where are they used in Ember?

## Code

### Property Rental Application

At the beginning of each day, follow along with the previous night's homework to implement new features and concepts into our Super-Rentals application.

<hr>

### Blog

Create a blog site for any area of interest you and your partner share. Consider choosing something you really care about and would like to share with others in the future!  You'll start with several static pages, and basic functionality for posts. <br>

#### Day One
#### _Posts, Basic Routing, Static Pages, Layout and Navigation_

Some features to include:

* At least two static pages, including an 'about' and 'contact' page.
* A navbar or header that includes links to the home, about and contact pages of your blog. It should appear on every page.
* Display all posts on the homepage.
* Allow the user to add new blog posts.
* Allow users an option to update existing posts.
* Allow users to delete posts they no longer want on the site.

### Further Exploration

* Limit the posts on the first page to the most recent 5.
* Add categories for posts and allow users to filter by categories.
* Add tags to post. Allow users to filter all posts based on tags.

## Peer Code Review
<hr>

* Users can update existing posts, and changes are reflected in Firebase.
* Posts can be deleted successfully.
* Routes are being used to control navigation throughout the application.
* Data is being manipulated between models and templates using components.
