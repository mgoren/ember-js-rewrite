This week, we'll continue our exploration of the [Ember JavaScript](http://emberjs.com/) framework. In addition to the general architecture and routing of the Ember environment, we'll spend time manipulating data, pulling in outside information with APIs, and taking advantages of many of the powerful tools built directly into the framework. 

Concepts and tools that we'll use this week include:

* Writing and calling custom helpers to quickly format data. 
* Combining or cross-referencing multiple pieces of data into single, easier-to-access properties with computed properties.
* Sorting and organizing data with computed properties.
* Gathering outside information from JSON web APIs.
* Using Ember Services to create online shopping carts. 
* Querying our Firebase data store.
* Nested Routing
* Google Maps as an Ember Service _(optional)_
* Pod Application Structure _(optional)_

### Independent Project Objectives

At the end of the week, your Independent Project will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* The application includes at least one computed property.
* A service has been implemented successfully.
* At least one custom helper is being used to format data.
* The application works as expected.
* Previous standards have been met. 
* You are able to discuss the flow of your code and the concepts behind it with an instructor using correct terminology.
