In the 5th week of this course we will be working on web applications in groups of four for the Epicodus Developer Trade Show to take place on the last Friday of class.  In preparation, we'll take the coming week to generate ideas and sign up for teams, so we'll be organized and ready to go first thing Monday of week 5!  

## Homework
<hr>

Generate an idea you would like to help develop into a working application. It could be a game, a new business idea, something educational, something fun, something to help others or something to change the world, an application or website a friend or family member could use, etc.

## Timeline
<hr>

### Monday and Tuesday:  Ideas

When you come in Monday morning, write your idea on the designated whiteboards including:

* Title and brief description of project
* Your name 
* The development language you are learning

Over the first two days of the week, ideas will be added and updated on the board. Students may sign up as they see projects that interest them. Talk to potential groups; ask questions; sign up for a project you feel most interested in and passionate about! 

### Wednesday:  Sign Up

Everyone is required to sign up for a team no later than Wednesday. Remember, **all teams should contain 4 students.** If a team already has 4 people, it is full and cannot take on additional members.  Sign up by entering your full name next to a project.

### Thursday:  Confirmation

Before the end of the day on Thursday, teachers will confirm that all teams have 4 members and can work in 2 pairs on their idea the following week. If teams are short members we'll help facilitate connecting with additional teammates, or re-arranging teams as necessary.

While you won't begin work on your project until the following Monday, feel free to trade contact information with your teammates, and start any planning or brainstorming outside of class!
