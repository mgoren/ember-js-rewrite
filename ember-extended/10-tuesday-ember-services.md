## Required Videos

Watch [Ember Screencast #82: Introduction to Services](https://www.emberscreencasts.com/posts/82-introduction-to-services) to familiarize yourself with Ember Services, how they work, and what can be accomplished with them. You're not required to follow along; this video is included so that we may see an example of an Ember Service, and gain a general understanding of the functionality they offer.

The video briefly mentions controllers. We won't inject our services into any controllers, but everything else featured in this screencast is still very applicable. Again, just focus on gaining a general understanding of what Services do. We'll cover the details of using Ember Services _without_ controllers in the next lesson.
