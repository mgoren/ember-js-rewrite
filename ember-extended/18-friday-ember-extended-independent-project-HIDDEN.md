## Project

<hr>

Choose _one_ of the following two project options. Each option will be reviewed for the same objectives listed below. 

### Crowd-Sourced Review Site

Create an application where users may rate local restaurants, or other areas of interest (ie: festivals, climbing gear, yoga classes, recipes, books, video games, local hikes, etc). 

* The restaurant (or whatever users will review in your app) will have many ratings. 
* Ratings may be any metric of your choosing, and could include a comment/explanation if you desire. 
* Use a helper to display nicely formatted timestamps, and/or represent ratings visually (ie: display stars, or thumbs up/thumbs down). 
* Include at least one computed property. 
* Use a service to allow users to create a list of "favorite restaurants" (or whatever thing users review in your specific app). 
* There should be an option to add new restaurants/things to review. This can either be an admin-style page, or something available to all users. 

#### Further Exploration 

* Use a computed property to calculate an average rating based on all user reviews, or another metric.
* Include a Google Map to display the location of individual restaurants. 
* Include a central Google Map that displays all restaurants.
* If applicable, use a nested route and/or Firebase query.
* Include search functionality.
* Allow users to sort by various categories or attributes.

### Continuation of Question & Answer Board

Continue developing the Question and Answer message board application from last week's independent project and code review by integrating the Ember features and functionality we learned this week. 

* Implement at least one computed property.
  * _Possible Ideas:_  Allow users to upvote the answer they think is best, then sort answers by number of upvotes.  Or display the number of answers each question has with a computed property. 
* Add a helper.
  * _Possible Ideas_:  Nicely-formatted timestamps on questions and/or answers, a formatting change or special icon for questions with _no_ answers, or questions with large numbers of answers, a formatting change or special icon for the answer with the most upvotes, etc. 
* Integrate a service.
  *  _Possible Ideas_:  Allow users to create lists of favorite questions or answers to reference later.

#### Further Exploration

* Allow users to upvote and downvote questions. Sort questions by number of votes. 
* Include additional computed properties.
* Use a nested route, if applicable.
* Implement a feature that uses a Firebase query.
* Integrate tags or categories to further organize questions.

## Objectives
<hr>

Both project options will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* The project contains at least one functioning computed property.
* A service has been implemented successfully.
* At least one custom helper is being used to format data.
* Previous standards have been met. 
* The application works as expected.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state. 
* You are able to discuss the flow of your code and the concepts behind it using correct terminology.
