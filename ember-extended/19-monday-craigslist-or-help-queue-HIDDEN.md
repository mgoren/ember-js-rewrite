**Goal:**  In addition to the tools and concepts we covered last week, practice implementing computed properties into your project.

## Warm Up
<hr>

* What is a computed property? What is it responsible for?
* When do we use computed properties, and when do we use helpers? 
* What is the difference between a computed property and a helper?
* Begin brainstorming potential group project ideas for next week with your partner. 

## Code
<hr>
Choose one of the following sites to build with your partner.  Before you get started, determine the site features and functionality you want to build. Think through the models, routes, templates and components and computed properties you'll need, and the order you want to build them. 

### Craigslist

[Craigslist](https://portland.craigslist.org/) is a hugely popular classified advertising website for buying and selling, jobs, events, personals, forums, etc.  For this project, explore Craigslist and then re-create a similar online marketplace.  Here are some user stories to get you started:

* As a user, I want to see all of the categories I can explore on the main page so I can decide where to go.
* As a user, I want to see all of the listings for a category when I select it.
* As a user, I want the most recent listings in a category displayed at the top of the page.
* As a user, I want to see the details for a listing when I select it (including when posted).
* As an admin, I want to be able to add, edit and delete a new listing in a category.

### Help Queue

For this project, re-create the Epicodus [Help Queue](https://help.epicodus.com).  Remember there is both a [user](https://help.epicodus.com) and [teacher](https://help.epicodus.com/#/queue)  side to the application.  Here are some user stories to get you started:

* As a user, I want to be able to log a new help ticket.
* As a user, I want to be able to close my ticket.
* As a teacher, I want to be able to see all of the help tickets for students who need assistance.
* As a teacher, I want to see how long a pair has been waiting. 

#### Further Exploration

* As a teacher, I want to see statistics for the day:  How many tickets were added, average wait time. 

## Peer Code Review
<hr>

* Does the application work as expected?
* Are custom helpers present? If so, are they correctly formatting data?
* Are computed properties present? If so, are they implemented successfully?
